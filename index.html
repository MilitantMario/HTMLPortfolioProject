    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am Nathan, and as people may know me as Militant Mario. A lot of what I engage in consists of coding, gaming, livestreaming, music, and playing saxophone. I created this site as sort of an online portfolio of myself and to gain experience in website development. I will expand on this later including but not limited to: A blog, custom forums, and all my project's information. This site will continue to grow, but keep in mind it will be subject to change and may be down at any time.
